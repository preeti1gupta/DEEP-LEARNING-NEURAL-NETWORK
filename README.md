#Image Classification using Transfer Learning VGG16 Model
Greendeck is a vendor who helps retailers in identifying / classification of images in correct categories & further helps in price intelligence.

This problem has potentially two aspects :
Image recognition - Identify & classify images in correct categories. 
Matching of products & retrieve further details (such as price / user ratings etc.)

As part of our project, Our aim is to build a model to recognize / classify images in potential categories. However second requirement is not in scope (future enhancements).

This problem comes under the category of “multi-label” classification.
